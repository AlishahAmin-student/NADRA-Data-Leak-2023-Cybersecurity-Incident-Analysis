## 🔐 CIA Triad Breakdown

### 1. Confidentiality
- **Definition:** Ensuring only authorized individuals can access sensitive data.
- **Failure:** Weak access controls, lack of encryption, and insider leaks.
- **Human Role:** Don't share sensitive data on public platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, social media).

### 2. Integrity
- **Definition:** Ensuring data is not tampered with without authorization.
- **Failure:** No monitoring systems allowed potential data manipulation.
- **Human Role:** Be trustworthy and ethical in handling data.

### 3. Availability
- **Definition:** Ensuring data is accessible when needed.
- **Failure:** Outdated software/hardware created risks of downtime or crashes.
- **Human Role:** Stay available and responsive in critical incidents.

---

## ✅ Additional Key Principles

### 🔒 Authenticity
- **Definition:** Verifying the identity of users/systems before granting access.
- **Failure:** Lack of 2FA or identity validation allowed unauthorized logins.
- **Solution:** Enforce verified credentials and strong authentication.

### 🧾 Non-Repudiation
- **Definition:** Ensuring actions cannot be denied by involved parties.
- **Failure:** No audit logs to trace who accessed or leaked the data.
- **Solution:** Implement logging, digital signatures, and user tracking.

## 🧪 NADRA Leak: Real-World Context

A NADRA employee with system access sells identity data via an unsecured PTCL router. Due to the **lack of encryption**, the data is easily intercepted by malicious actors. The **absence of real-time monitoring** allows the breach to remain undetected for years. With **no proper access logs**, the insider cannot be identified or held accountable.

This scenario illustrates violations of **all pillars of the CIA Triad**, as well as failures in **Authenticity** and **Non-Repudiation**.

## 🛡️ Solutions to Prevent Future Breaches

To prevent future breaches like the NADRA incident, organizations should:

- ✅ Enforce **strong passwords** and **two-factor authentication (2FA)**
- ✅ Avoid use of **public/open Wi-Fi** in sensitive offices
- ✅ **Encrypt all sensitive and personal data**
- ✅ Implement **least privilege access policies**
- ✅ Deploy **real-time 24/7 activity monitoring systems**
- ✅ Regularly **update systems and hardware**
- ✅ Use **secure, verified network hardware** (e.g., routers, switches)
- ✅ Maintain **comprehensive audit logs** for non-repudiation and traceability
